# Docker Configurations

This folder contains Docker-related configurations for containerized services.

## Structure
- **compose/**: Docker Compose files for running multi-container services.
  - Each service (e.g., Nginx, PostgreSQL) has its own subfolder containing a \`compose.yaml\` file and any necessary environment files (e.g., \`.env\`).
- **images/**: Custom Dockerfiles for building custom images.
